        It's kinda new concept, yet easy to understand. 

        Let's review the 'stack' & 'heap' data structure. 
            => Stack: LIFO  Last-In, First-Out
            => Heap : FIFO  First-In, Last-Out

        For 'stack', 
            -> <add>    pushing onto	
            -> <del>    poping  off	    ('stack' opt on top ONLY)

            Cuz it opt on top ONLY, 
                => fast     cuz u don't have search elsewhere
                => fast     fixed size (ya only add/del on top(end))

        For 'heap', 
            | data with a size 
            | unknown at compile time (or'll change)

            Unlike 'stack', ya had to 
                (pre) allocate (not) fixed space (toPrepare) for it. 

            The OS 'finds' somewhere that is big enough 
                => mark it as 'being in use'
                => returns a pointer (i.e. memory-addr)

            You CAN store the pointer on the 'stack', 
                ya still need to follow the pointer (which is on 'heap')

            Conceptually, reason for why 'heap' is slower is that 
                => allocating   Unlike 'stack', ya just put it on the top. 
                => accessing    Same idea. Plus ya need 'from pointer to data'.

        In short,
            => the 'heap' is slower than access data on the 'stack'
            => (might not be true for contem-processor, but, well..)

        So .. why we need 'ownership'? 

        Let's taking for an example. 
            -> Ya called a func, val passed into it (might pt to heap)
            -> Local var psh-on-stack | over | local var pp-off-stack

        ... Hmm? 

        Here's the concerns. 
            => Keeping track of what parts of code're using what data 
            => Minimizing the amount of duplicated data on the 'heap'
            => Cleaning up unused data on it (e.g. mem-leak if go bad)

        'Ownership' is here for help!

            => out of scople (i.e. {}) -> its val was dropped 

        Well, in short,

        Well, 'allocate' is just the first step.

        So .. we need to find a way!  
        
        Rust took a different path, 
            -> the mem is automatically returned 
            -> once <the var that owns it> goes out of scope (i.e. {})

        Down below is (just) a simple example,

        What did the 's1' do? 
            | String type => allocate enough space 
            | then store the 'yo ...' onto the 'heap'

            Three things were related to this: 
                => Pointer      starting addr on memory 
                => Length       how much mem it was using (in bytes)
                => Capacity     the total mem was allocated  

        When we assigning 's1' to 's2', 
            -> we're actually only 
                => copying (i.e. assgin) the 
                => pointer (i.e. mem-addr) to 's2'. 

        So .. when the variables goes out scope, 
            | Rust willl calls the 'drop' and cleans up the heap mem. 
        
        Bang! That's where's the problem occurs :p 

        Since the 's2' & 's1' both points to the same addr 
            => the same memory might be "freed twice" 
            => which could result in mem corruption, even security issues.

                => all the float types      e.g. f64

            => fixed
            => quick-to-make 
            => have a known size at compl time  (for str, which is not)
