### Purpose 
- Digging deep while needed.

### Resource 
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/2018-edition/foreword.html#foreword)

### Note 
- Add ```--vcs none``` to ```cargo new``` will create a **Rust** project without **Git**.
- Just like I do. There are quite a few projects in this one single repo.
